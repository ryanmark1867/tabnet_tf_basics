# README for TabNet TensorFlow basics repo

Repo for upcoming Manning book on machine learning for tabular data. 

This repo contains a TabNet on TensorFlow solution to prediction of [Airbnb NYC listing prices](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data). The solution is based on the [Keras-based solution](https://github.com/ryanmark1867/deep_learning_basics) with the following changes in the [model training](https://github.com/ryanmark1867/tabnet_basics/blob/master/notebooks/model_training.ipynb) notebook:
- replace Keras model training in model training notebook with TabNet model training

The code in this repo is based on the example here: [https://github.com/titu1994/tf-TabNet/blob/master/examples/train_iris.py](https://github.com/titu1994/tf-TabNet/blob/master/examples/train_iris.py).
